# Swift and Objective-C Counter
This code prints the number of Objective-C and Swift repositories on GitHub.
For the 19th of April there are a total count of 534489 Objective-C repositories and 986992 Swift repositories.
Additionally, 3752 Swift repositories are found with the `server` tag. 
Before the introduction of Swift in 2014 there had been 77210 Objective-C repositories.

These numbers might decrease if repositories get deleted.

To get the code to produce more current data alter the `createdBefore` constant in the `main.ts` file.

To run the code execute `npm install`, `npm run compile`, and `npm run start`.
